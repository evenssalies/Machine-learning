## Classification - Semi-Supervised learning (SSL)[^1]

### Evens Salies, v1: 01/2025

In ML, the concept of SSL is used in situations where, for some $i$'s, $Y_i$ is not observed. In econometrics, such a situation occurs when $Y_i$ is missing at random (MAR) or when there is sample selection. E.g., $Y$ is salary, $X$ tells whether $i$ has a job or not, $D$ is a dummy that takes the value 1 if $i$ has followed some training program:

```math
(Y_i, D_i, X_i).

```

Split the set of $n$ individuals $I$ into two subsets $I_U$ and $I_L$ where indices "U"  and "L" stand for "unlabelled" and "labeled". Without loss of generality, $I_U\equiv\lbrace 1,\ldots,m\rbrace$, $m<n$, and $I_L\equiv I\setminus I_U$.
