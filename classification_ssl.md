## Classification - Semi-Supervised learning (SSL)[^1]

### Evens Salies, v1: 01/2025

In ML, the concept of SSL is used in situations where $y_i$ is not observed for some $(y_i, \mathbf{x}_i)$. In econometrics, such a situation occurs when $y_i$ is missing at random (MAR) or when there sample selection. E.g., $y$ is salary, $x_3$ tells whether $i$ works or not, $x_2$ is a dummy for training, and $x_1$ a bias. $(y_i, \mathbf{x}_i) = (y_i, 1, x_{2i}, x_{3i})$.
